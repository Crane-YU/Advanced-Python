# Global Interpreter Lock
- only allow one thread to run in python
- 

# Thread notice
- When creating a thread, if the subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure to invoke base class constructor
(`Thread.__init__()`)before doing any change.
- `start()`: Start the thread's activity, and it arranges for the object's `run()` method to start.
- `run()`: Method representing the thread activity.
- If not using `join()`, then the main thread will terminate once its work is done, without
waiting for the child threads.
